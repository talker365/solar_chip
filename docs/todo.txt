Goals:
1- Edit Installation / Routine Scripts:
	Handle AP / MESH processes in the mmconfig scripting.

2- Switch Use of WLAN1 for (AP Router or MESH node modes) and concentrate on use ethernet port for both router and mesh uses.

3- Completion of Installation Webpages & test.
	Upon completing the Webpages for Router and Mesh, we can try to wrap up both modes.

5- Upon completion of Installation, re-direct to a Status Page.
	From here we can determine what pages, format, etc is needed for Router / Mesh types.

	Page Idea's: 
		- Status: # of Connected Nodes on AP / Router 

		- Status: If Battery is Equipped	
			Power Status: (Mains / Emg Backup ie.. battery usage)
			Battery Voltage
			Battery Current Status ( ".425 ma" Positive amperage charging / "-600.ma" discharging)
		
		- Statis: Typical Router / Mesh Info
			IP Address, Netmask, Gateway etc...

		- Admin: Typical Network & Password Changes.
			VTUNNEL Setup




Idea's 

Add a Build# with each execution of build script and Displayed During Installation.
